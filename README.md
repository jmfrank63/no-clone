# Rust Option Take and Retry Example

This project demonstrates the use of Rust's `Option<T>` for handling values that may or may not
exist, showcasing a pattern where a value is taken out of an `Option`, processed, and potentially
put back for a retry.

## Overview

The code provides an example of a retry mechanism using a custom struct `NoClone` that does not
implement the `Copy` or `Clone` traits. This struct is wrapped in an `Option`, and the `take()`
method is used to consume the value for processing. If the processing fails, the value is modified
and returned for a retry.

## Usage

The main logic is contained in `main.rs`. Run the Rust program to see the retry mechanism in action.
